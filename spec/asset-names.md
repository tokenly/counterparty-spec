# Asset Names

## Types of Counterparty Assets

* Textual (also called "Named"): begin with a letter other than `A` and may contain letters A-Z
* Alphanumeric (also called "Numeric"): begin with `A` followed by a large integer number. 

The both types are case-insensitive. Refer to pthis page](https://counterparty.io/docs/assets/) for additional details.

### Decoding Asset Names

An asset ID is a 64 bit number.  

There are 2 special asset IDs.  Asset id `0` is BTC and asset id `1` is XCP.

Asset IDs greater than 1 and less than 17576 (0x44A8) are invalid.

To convert an asset ID into a name, repeatedly divide the asset ID by 26, round down and convert each remainder into a character until the result of the division is 0.  The name is built from the last letter to the first letter.

```
Example of converting 000000000004fadf (326367) into a name

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
||||                    |└── 25
|||└───── 3             └─ 24
||└──── 2
|└─── 1
└── 0

326367 / 26 = 12552 remainder 15. 15 translates to P. The Asset is P.
12552 / 26  = 482   remainder 20. 20 translates to U. The Asset is UP.
482 / 26    = 18    remainder 14. 14 translates to O. The Asset is OUP.
18 / 26     = 0     remainder 18. 18 translates to S. The Asset is SOUP.

Alphanumeric assets (example: `A9999999999999999999`) have an Asset ID that is equal to their name without the leading letter `A` (example for asset from this sentence: `9999999999999999999`).
